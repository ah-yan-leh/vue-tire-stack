Falken specifically designed this tire to accommodate crossovers' higher center of gravity, promoting long wear, handling, and stability. Built with a silica-enriched tread compound, the Ziex CT60 A/S also gives your CUV excellent traction and shorter stopping distances on wet and snowy roads. An asymmetric tread design and wide circumferential grooves deliver strong grip and rain and snow, helping to prevent hydroplaning. And the tread is designed to give you a quiet, comfortable ride -- in short, this tire is everything you want for your crossover. Falken Ziex CT60 A/S LT Tire, 235/55R18, 28046809.",
